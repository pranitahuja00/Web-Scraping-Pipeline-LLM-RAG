The benefit of shopping will far outweigh any impact on your credit.\n\nIn some cases, applying for multiple loans over a long period of time can impact your credit score(s). Lenders can make requests, also known as inquiries, to access your credit files from the consumer credit reporting companies. These requests will generally only count as a single inquiry if they’re made within 14 to 45 days of each other. Shopping for two different types of loans, such as a mortgage loan and an auto loan, will count as two separate credit inquiries.\nTo get the best deal and minimize any negative impact on your credit:\nCheck your credit scores and reports\n– One of the most important first steps is to check your reports for any errors or inaccuracies that might be impacting your scores. If you find errors, you want to\ndispute that information in order to have it removed\n.\nShop around with multiple lenders before shopping for a vehicle\n– Get preapprovals with different lenders before going to a dealer. This helps you compare offers and loan terms to get the best deal and could save hundreds or even thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.\nLimit your loan shopping to 14-45 days\n– Keeping your shopping within this time span generally means that any requests from lenders to check your credit will count as one credit inquiry.\nKnow before you shop for a car or auto loan\nBy asking questions before you shop, you’re more likely to get the best interest rates and loan terms for your budget. Plus, you’ll save time, money, and reduce stress.\nAsk more essential questions before you shop for auto loans\n\nPage last modified\nJan. 30, 2024\n\n@\n\n02:31 PM EST\n\nView older versions of this page at our public archive.", "fetched_at": "2025-12-08T05:50:26.351719", "crawl_depth": 1, "parent_url": "https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/", "content_type": "faq", "language": "en", "word_count": 330, "char_count": 1870, "estimated_reading_time_min": 1.65, "num_headings": 2, "topical_tags": ["disputes", "interest"], "extra_metadata": {"headings": ["How will shopping for an auto loan affect my credit?", "Know before you shop for a car or auto loan"]}}

The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a measure of the interest rate plus the additional fees charged with the loan. Both are expressed as a percentage.\n\nA loan’s interest rate and APR are two of the most important measures of the price you pay for borrowing money.\nInterest rate\nAn interest rate is the cost you pay to the lender for borrowing money to finance your loan, on top of the\nloan amount or your principal\n. The higher the interest rate, the more you’ll pay over the life of your loan.\nAnnual Percentage Rate (APR)\nThe APR is the interest rate\nplus\nany additional fees charged by the lender. This includes origination charges and other fees charged when the loan is made.\nHow to get the best rates\nIn general, the\nhigher your credit score, the lower your rates will be\n. However, dealers and lenders are not required to offer you the best available rates. The best way to reduce your costs is to\nshop around and compare rates between different lenders\n.\nWhat lenders are required to provide\nThe federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) requires lenders to give you specific disclosures about the important terms in your loan, including the APR. They must provide this info before you finalize your car loan. Since all lenders must provide the APR, you can use the APR to compare auto loans. Just make sure you’re comparing APRs to APRs and not APRs to interest rates because the two are not the same.\nKnow before you shop for a car or auto loan\nBy asking questions before you shop, you’re more likely to get the best interest rates and loan terms for your budget.

Be sure to ask about their policies.\n\nNext Business Day\n\nIn general, the following deposits must be made available by the next business day:\nCash deposited in-person\nChecks for $225 or less deposited in-person\nElectronic payments (wire transfers and ACH deposits)\nGovernment, cashier's, and certified checks deposited in-person or at the institution's ATMs\nPersonal checks deposited in-person and drawn from the same institution\nYour bank or credit union has a cut-off time for what it considers the end of the business day. If you make a deposit after the cut-off time, the bank or credit union can treat your deposit as if it was made on the next business day. A bank or credit union’s cut-off time for receiving deposits can be no earlier than 2:00 p.m. at physical locations and no earlier than noon at an ATM or elsewhere.\n\nLonger Holds\n\nIn general, banks or credit unions may hold deposits more than one business day if:\nThe account has been open for less than 30 days\nThe account has been overdrawn too many times in the last six months (check your bank for specific policies)\nIf you made a deposit at an ATM owned by another institution\nThe bank believes the deposited check may be uncollectible\nThe bank suspects fraud\nThere's an unexpected outage or emergency situation like a natural disaster\nYou deposit a check for more than $5,525 (see below)\nWhen you deposit a check for more than $5,525:\n$225 must be available the next business day\nAmounts up to $5,525 must be available within two business days if the deposited check is a local check\nAmounts over $5,525 are generally available within seven business days\n\nPage last modified\nSept. 19, 2025\n\n@\n\n12:29 PM EDT\n\nView older versions of this page at our public archive.", "fetched_at": "2025-12-08T05:50:27.643100", "crawl_depth": 1, "parent_url": "https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/", "content_type": "faq", "language": "en", "word_count": 360, "char_count": 2094, "estimated_reading_time_min": 1.8, "num_headings": 3, "topical_tags": ["payments"], "extra_metadata": {"headings": ["How long can a bank or credit union hold funds I deposited?", "Next Business Day", "Longer Holds"]}}

Under this arrangement, you still sign your checks, and no one else is authorized to make account transactions.\nIf you have no friends or family members to help you with informal money management, there are organized programs that provide trained staff members or volunteers to help. To locate a money management program in your area, try contacting your local\nArea Agency on Aging\n\n. You may also be able to find a money management program along with other resources for older Americans by contacting the\nEldercare Locator\n\nat eldercare.acl.gov or by calling 1-800-677-1116.\nIf you get help from a money management program, though, check on whether the program has insurance or bonding so your money is protected in a worst-case scenario, including mismanagement or theft by the person assisting you.\nOpen a convenience account\nA “convenience account” or “agency account” enables you to designate a family member or friend to help you with depositing or withdrawing money and writing checks.\nA convenience account doesn’t change the ownership of the money in the account or give your helper the right to keep the money when you die. However, any friend or family member you designate to help you can both deposit and withdraw money from your account, which exposes you to the risk that they might withdraw your money for their own use.\nIf you’re interested in a convenience or agency account, ask your bank\nOften bank employees don’t mention these options or know they exist. You may need to speak with a manager. Explain that you want an account in which the money remains yours but that someone else’s name will be on the account to help you with bill paying and other transactions. If you don’t intend for your money to become your helper’s money upon your death, be sure to say that you don’t want a joint account where the other person has the “right of survivorship.”\nAdd a trusted contact person to your accounts\nSome banks may also offer the option to add a “trusted contact person” to your brokerage accounts. This allows your financial institution to contact the trusted person in certain circumstances, like if they believe you’re getting scammed. Trusted contacts don’t have access to your money – they simply get notified if the financial institution sees signs of financial exploitation. Learn more about how\nchoosing a trusted contact person\n\ncould help you safeguard your finances.\nSet up a power of attorney for finances\nYou can also choose a friend or family member to act on your behalf by creating and signing a document called a\npower of attorney\n(POA) or “durable” power of attorney. If you have a POA, your bank account can remain in your name only, but the person you name as your power of attorney – or your “agent” – can help you with banking. If you or your agent shares a copy of the power of attorney document with bank employees, they should honor the document and allow your agent to handle your bank transactions on your behalf.\nAgain, give considerable thought before granting anyone power of attorney, as they could withdraw money from your account without your permission.\nConsidering a financial caregiver?\nLearn your options.\n\nPage last modified\nMar. 18, 2024\n\n@\n\n03:33 PM EDT\n\nView older versions of this page at our public archive.", "fetched_at": "2025-12-08T05:50:28.268517", "crawl_depth": 1, "parent_url": "https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/", "content_type": "faq", "language": "en", "word_count": 650, "char_count": 3813, "estimated_reading_time_min": 3.25, "num_headings": 6, "topical_tags": [], "extra_metadata": {"headings": ["Can a family member or friend help me with bill paying and banking?", "Receive informal help with money management", "Open a convenience account", "If you’re interested in a convenience or agency account, ask your bank", "Add a trusted contact person to your accounts", "Set up a power of attorney for finances"]}}
